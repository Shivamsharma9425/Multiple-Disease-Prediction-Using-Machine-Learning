## 🚀 Features

- 🩺 Diabetes Prediction — based on parameters like glucose level, BMI, pregnancies, etc.
- ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction — using chest pain type, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, etc.
- 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Prediction — based on voice-related measurements.

- Clean, intuitive UI using #Streamlit
- Trained models for each disease using real-world datasets
- Live prediction based on user input
